# HowTo-Configure-OpenVAS
This repository contains a file named [kali-openvas-howto.md](kali-openvas-howto.md) containing step-by-step directions for setting up Kali Linux and OpenVAS.
It is specifically written to help others duplicate a configuration that was used to test professional media systems, but it will work in any application where someone wants to use OpenVAS to perform long-running scans of multiple systems.
